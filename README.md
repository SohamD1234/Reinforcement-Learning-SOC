# Reinforcement Learning

This is the repository for the 2023 Seasons of Code Project "Hands on Reinforcement Learning".

## Mentors

- Ashwin Abraham
- Jujhaar Singh
- Prerak Contractor
- Sankalp Bhamare

## Instructions for Mentees

The assignments for each week will be posted here. You must make a pull request with your solutions, and the best solution will be accepted.

Your solution should ideally be in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. Some assignments will build off each other to form the project.
